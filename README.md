# HonoX Minimal Blog Template

A minimal blog template built with [HonoX](https://github.com/honojs/honox), Tailwind CSS, and MDX.

As with my [next-minimal-blog](https://github.com/cakegaly/next-minimal-blog), now trying the same minimalist approach with HonoX.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still work in progress. I'm planning to release this as a public template soon! ðŸ”¥
